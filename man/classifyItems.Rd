\usage{
classifyItems(
  fm,
  Df,
  min.loading = 0.4,
  max.loading = 0.3,
  max.complexity = 2,
  itemlength = 0,
  digits = 2,
  Df.name = deparse(substitute(Df)),
  return.res = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fm}{a factor model fitted by psych::fa or principal components computed with psych::principal}

\item{Df}{a data frame containing the items}

\item{min.loading}{minimum loading of an item to be considered a marker of a factor}

\item{max.loading}{maximum loading of an item on a secondary factor (i.e., the factor on which the items has its second highest loading) to be considered a marker for the primary factor (i.e., the factor on which the items has its highest loading)}

\item{max.complexity}{maximum complexity of an item to be considered a marker item. This is only used for factor models (not for principal components)}

\item{itemlength}{trim item text to given number characters (0 = automatic trimming)}

\item{digits}{number of digits used in the output}

\item{Df.name}{name of data frame}

\item{return.res}{(logical) if TRUE, return output as a list of data frames instead of simply printing the output. This is used by Iana to render the output via renderTable().}
