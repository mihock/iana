\usage{
empICC(x, score = c("factor.thomson", "factor.bartlett", "mean", "sum"),
  method = "loess", span = 0.75, alpha = 0, jitter = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame in which rows are subjects and colums are test items}

\item{score}{total score to use}

\item{method}{function to use for curve fitting, e.g. "loess" or "lm"}

\item{span}{degree of smoothing used for loess (see \code{\link{loess}})}

\item{alpha}{opaqueness of the points in the scatterplot}

\item{jitter}{amount of jitter}
}
\description{
Plot of empirical ICCs of the items in a data frame.
}
\details{
To examine item characteristics, item scores are plotted against total scores or factor scores. To avoid overplotting, a small amount of jitter is added to overlapping points. In the upper left corner, the correlation of the total/factor score and the item score is given. The lines are locally weighted regression lines, the shaded regions represent 95\% confidence intervals around the expected item scores. If many data points are present it may be useful to decrease the opaqueness of the points and/or to deactivate jitter.
